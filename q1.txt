Because the doctor tricked them to look at each other.

All of the angels can actally move forward but they wait for each other, which is a 
similar mechanism as the "livelock" saying that "You go first".

Angel A looks at Angel B.
Angel B looks at Angel C.
Angel C looks at Angel B.
Angel D looks at Angel C.

Graph is like this:

A      D
 \    /
  \  /
   \/
   /\
| /  \ |
|/_  _\|

C<---->B


Because all of them can move forward, it is not a "deadlock". 

Hence, it is a "livelock".
